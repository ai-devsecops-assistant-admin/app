# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Platform Governance team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to **security@example.com**
2. **Private Vulnerability Reporting**: Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/example/platform-governance/security/advisories/new) feature

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of affected source files
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies based on severity
  - **Critical**: 1-7 days
  - **High**: 7-30 days
  - **Medium**: 30-90 days
  - **Low**: Best effort basis

## Security Measures

### Supply Chain Security

#### SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

- All container images include SPDX-format SBOMs
- Generated using Syft on every release
- Available as attestations via Cosign

```bash
# Fetch SBOM for an image
cosign download attestation --type spdx \
  registry.example.com/my-app-api:v1.0.0
```

#### SLSA Provenance

- All releases include SLSA Level 3 provenance
- Build provenance generated via GitHub Actions
- Signed with Sigstore

```bash
# Verify SLSA provenance
cosign verify-attestation --type slsaprovenance \
  --certificate-identity-regexp="^https://github.com/.*" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  registry.example.com/my-app-api:v1.0.0
```

#### Image Signing

All container images are signed with Cosign (keyless):

```bash
# Verify image signature
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp="^https://github.com/example/platform-governance.*" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  registry.example.com/my-app-api:v1.0.0
```

### Vulnerability Scanning

#### Automated Scans

- **Trivy**: File system and container scanning (daily)
- **CodeQL**: Static application security testing (on every PR)
- **Gitleaks**: Secret scanning (on every commit)
- **Semgrep**: SAST for custom security patterns
- **Checkov**: Infrastructure as Code scanning

#### Dependency Scanning

- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **npm audit**: Node.js dependency vulnerabilities
- **go mod**: Go module vulnerability checks

### Runtime Security

#### Falco

Runtime security monitoring with custom rules:

- Detects unexpected process execution
- Monitors file system changes
- Tracks network connections
- Identifies privilege escalation attempts

```bash
# View Falco alerts
kubectl logs -n falco -l app=falco --tail=100
```

#### Pod Security

All production pods enforce:

- **runAsNonRoot**: true
- **readOnlyRootFilesystem**: true
- **allowPrivilegeEscalation**: false
- **capabilities**: DROP ALL

### Network Security

#### Zero-Trust NetworkPolicies

- Default deny all ingress/egress
- Explicit allow rules for required traffic
- Namespace isolation

```bash
# View NetworkPolicies
kubectl get networkpolicy -A
```

#### mTLS

- Service-to-service encryption via Istio
- Certificate rotation every 24 hours
- SPIFFE/SPIRE for workload identity

### Policy Enforcement

#### OPA/Conftest

- Naming convention enforcement
- Resource limits validation
- Security context validation

#### Kyverno

- ClusterPolicies for governance
- Mutation policies for defaults
- Generate policies for required resources

#### Gatekeeper

- Admission control validation
- Constraint templates for custom policies
- Audit mode for policy violations

### Secret Management

#### Sealed Secrets

- Encrypted secrets stored in Git
- Decryption only in-cluster
- Namespace/name scoped encryption

```bash
# Create a sealed secret
./scripts/security/seal-secret.sh db-creds prod \
  host=db.example.com password=secret123
```

#### Secret Rotation

- Database credentials: 90 days
- API keys: 90 days
- TLS certificates: 90 days (auto-renewed at 60 days)
- Service account tokens: 1 year

### Access Control

#### RBAC

- Principle of least privilege
- Role-based access control
- Regular access reviews (quarterly)

#### Authentication

- OAuth2/OIDC for user authentication
- Service accounts for workload identity
- MFA required for production access

### Compliance

#### Frameworks

- SOC 2 Type II
- ISO 27001
- NIST CSF

#### Audit Logging

- Kubernetes audit logs enabled
- API access logs
- Database query logs
- 1-year retention

### Security Scanning Schedule

| Tool | Frequency | Trigger |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Trivy | Daily | Schedule |
| CodeQL | Per PR | Pull Request |
| Gitleaks | Per commit | Push |
| Semgrep | Per PR | Pull Request |
| Checkov | Per PR | Pull Request |
| Dependency scan | Daily | Schedule |
| Container scan | Per build | Release |

## Security Contacts

- **Security Team**: security@example.com
- **Incident Response**: oncall@example.com (24/7)
- **Bug Bounty**: https://example.com/security/bounty

## Known Security Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Currently configured conservatively; may need tuning
2. **Audit Log Retention**: 1 year (consider increasing for compliance)
3. **Secret Rotation**: Manual process for some secrets

### Future Improvements

- [ ] Implement HashiCorp Vault for dynamic secrets
- [ ] Add Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- [ ] Implement automated secret rotation
- [ ] Add intrusion detection system (IDS)

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Review

- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Use `git-secrets` or `gitleaks` pre-commit hooks
- Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Follow secure coding guidelines

### Testing

- Include security tests in test suites
- Test authentication and authorization
- Validate input sanitization
- Check for injection vulnerabilities

### Dependencies

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review dependency licenses
- Audit transitive dependencies
- Pin dependency versions

## Incident Response

### Severity Classification

**Critical** (P0):
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Data breach
- Privilege escalation to admin

**High** (P1):
- SQL injection
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Sensitive data exposure
- Denial of service

**Medium** (P2):
- CSRF vulnerabilities
- Information disclosure
- Insecure defaults

**Low** (P3):
- Security misconfigurations
- Missing security headers
- Weak cryptography

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledge**: Confirm receipt within 48 hours
2. **Assess**: Evaluate severity and impact
3. **Fix**: Develop and test patch
4. **Deploy**: Roll out fix to affected systems
5. **Disclose**: Coordinate disclosure with reporter
6. **Learn**: Conduct post-incident review
